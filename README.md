# Ofin
A hotkey scripting language.

This is currently a work in progress.

## Installation

The only method available as of now to install Ofin is from source.  
Assuming you have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (and cargo) installed you should be able to simply run:  
```
cargo install --git https://github.com/Nigecat/Ofin` to install Ofin.
```  
This adds the `ofin` binary to your PATH. For usage details run `ofin --help`
